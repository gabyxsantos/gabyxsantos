## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a Data Science undergraduate student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), deeply interested in how we can uncover hidden connections within large-scale datasets.

Currently, I am conducting **Scientific Research** focused on **Cross-Domain Recommendation Systems**. My work involves analyzing massive datasets (like Amazon Reviews 2023) to find similarity patterns between different media domains—such as books, movies, and music—using user behavior data, even in sparse data scenarios.

I am passionate about the entire data pipeline: from handling big data with terminal tools to statistical modeling and visualization.

## 🔬 Current Research: Similarity Bridges

**Project:** *Finding Similarity Bridges: A Cross-Domain Analysis of Sparse User Data*

In my current research, I am tackling the challenge of data sparsity in recommendation systems.
- **Objective:** To quantify item affinity across different domains (Books, Movies, Music) using user ratings.
- **Methodology:** I developed a hybrid processing pipeline (Terminal + Python) to handle +6GB files, applied k-core filtering to reduce sparsity, and implemented a **Cosine Similarity** model based on explicit ratings to serve as a ground truth for future machine learning models.
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn), Bash (awk, jq), Matplotlib/Seaborn.
